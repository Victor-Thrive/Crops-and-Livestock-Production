## 1. Introduction

This report documents the steps taken to devlop a churn prediction model using machine learning techniques

### 1.1 Project Title

Crops and Livestock Production Analysis

### 1.2 Aim and Objectives

-   **Aim**: To develop a predictive model that accurately identifies customers who are likely to churn.
-   **Objectives**:
    -   Collect and preprocess customer data.
    -   Explore and analyze the data to identify key features influencing churn.
    -   Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
    -   Deploy the best-performing model in a user-friendly dashboard.

## 2. Data Information

### 2.1 Data Source

-   **Source**: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle or any other relevant source.
-   **Description**: The dataset contains customer information, including demographic details, account information, and service usage patterns.

### 2.2 Metadata

-   **Columns**:
    -   `customerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
    -   `gender`: Gender of the customer.
    -   `SeniorCitizen`: Indicates if the customer is a senior citizen.
    -   `Partner`: Indicates if the customer has a partner.
    -   `Dependents`: Indicates if the customer has dependents.
    -   `tenure`: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
    -   `PhoneService`: Indicates if the customer has phone service.
    -   `MultipleLines`: Indicates if the customer has multiple lines.
    -   `InternetService`: Type of internet service the customer has.
    -   `OnlineSecurity`: Indicates if the customer has online security.
    -   `OnlineBackup`: Indicates if the customer has online backup.
    -   `DeviceProtection`: Indicates if the customer has device protection.
    -   `TechSupport`: Indicates if the customer has tech support.
    -   `StreamingTV`: Indicates if the customer has streaming TV.
    -   `StreamingMovies`: Indicates if the customer has streaming movies.
    -   `Contract`: Type of contract the customer has.
    -   `PaperlessBilling`: Indicates if the customer has paperless billing.
    -   `PaymentMethod`: Method of payment used by the customer.
    -   `MonthlyCharges`: Monthly charges incurred by the customer.
    -   `TotalCharges`: Total charges incurred by the customer.
    -   `Churn`: Indicates if the customer has churned.

## 3. Research Questions

-   What are the key factors that influence customer churn?
-   How accurately can we predict customer churn using machine learning models?
-   Which machine learning model performs best for churn prediction?

## 4. Data Cleaning

-   Handle missing values.
-   Correct data types (e.g., convert `TotalCharges` to numeric).
-   Remove duplicates.

## 5. Data Preprocessing

-   Normalize numerical features.
-   Encode categorical features.
-   Split the data into training and testing sets.

## 6. Data Exploration

-   Summary statistics of the data.
-   Visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar charts, correlation matrix).
-   Insights from exploratory data analysis.

## 7. Modelling

-   Define and train multiple models (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, random forest).
-   Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curve, feature importance and F1 score.
-   Select the best-performing model.
-   Summary of findings and recommendations

## 8. Dashboard Building

-   Use Quarto to create an interactive dashboard.
-   Include sections for model performance metrics, ROC curve, feature importance, and customer segmentation.
-   Add interactive filters and visualizations.

## 9. Deployment

-   Deploy the dashboard using a web hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify).
-   Ensure the dashboard is accessible and user-friendly.

## 10. Collaborators

-   **R4DataScienceNigeria Team**:
    -   Collaborator 1
    -   Collaborator 2
    -   Collaborator 3

## 11. Collaboration and Version Control

-   Initialize a git repository `git init`

-   Add files to the repo `git add`

-   Commit changes \`git commit -m "Initial commit"

-   Push to Github `git push`
